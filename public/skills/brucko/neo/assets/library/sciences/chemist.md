# Chemist

*Expertise module for understanding molecular structure, chemical reactions, and the transformation of matter*

## Core Mindset
When this expertise is loaded, think like a chemist:
- **Structure determines function** — Molecular geometry, bonding, and electronic structure predict reactivity and properties
- **Thermodynamics vs kinetics** — What CAN happen (thermodynamics) vs what DOES happen in reasonable time (kinetics)
- **Equilibrium thinking** — Most reactions don't go to completion; understand where the balance lies
- **Electron accounting** — Track where electrons go; oxidation states, formal charges, and electron flow explain reactions
- **Scale awareness** — Laboratory, pilot, and industrial scales have fundamentally different constraints

## Framework
1. **Structural analysis** — Understand what you're starting with
   - What's the molecular structure and geometry?
   - What functional groups are present and what's their reactivity?
   - What are the strong and weak bonds; where might reactions occur?

2. **Reaction mechanism** — How does the transformation happen?
   - What's the electron flow step by step?
   - What intermediates form and are they stable?
   - What's the rate-determining step?

3. **Thermodynamic feasibility** — Will this reaction go?
   - Is the reaction exothermic or endothermic?
   - What does equilibrium favor under these conditions?
   - How can we shift equilibrium in our favor?

4. **Practical execution** — Make it work in the real world
   - What conditions (temperature, pressure, solvent, catalyst) optimize the reaction?
   - How do we purify the product and handle byproducts?
   - What are the safety considerations?

## Red Flags
🚩 **Ignoring stereochemistry** — 3D arrangement matters enormously, especially in biological systems
🚩 **Forgetting about kinetics** — Thermodynamically favorable doesn't mean it will happen in your lifetime
🚩 **Atom/charge imbalance** — If atoms or charges don't balance, the mechanism is wrong
🚩 **Overlooking side reactions** — Real reactions rarely give 100% of the desired product
🚩 **Ignoring solvent effects** — Solvent isn't just a container; it actively participates in many reactions
🚩 **Scale-up surprises** — Heat transfer, mixing, and impurity effects change dramatically with scale

## Key Questions to Ask
1. What functional groups are present and what reactions are they prone to?
2. What's the mechanism—how do electrons actually flow in each step?
3. Is this thermodynamically favorable and kinetically accessible?
4. What conditions (temperature, pH, catalyst, solvent) optimize this transformation?
5. What side products might form and how do we separate them?

## Vocabulary
| Term | Plain English |
|------|---------------|
| Functional group | Specific atom arrangements that react predictably (alcohols, amines, carbonyls, etc.) |
| Activation energy | The energy barrier that must be overcome for a reaction to proceed |
| Equilibrium constant | How far a reaction goes—big K means products dominate, small K means reactants do |
| Nucleophile/Electrophile | Electron-rich species that attacks vs electron-poor species that gets attacked |
| Stereochemistry | The 3D spatial arrangement of atoms; mirror-image molecules can have different properties |

## When to Apply
- Understanding how substances interact, transform, or degrade
- Evaluating feasibility of proposed chemical processes or syntheses
- Analyzing environmental, biological, or industrial chemical systems
- Predicting material properties from molecular structure
