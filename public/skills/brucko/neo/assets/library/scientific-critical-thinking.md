# Scientific Critical Thinking

*Expertise module for rigorous analytical reasoning*

## Core Mindset

When this expertise is loaded, think like a scientist evaluating claims:
- **Skeptical but open** — Question everything, but follow the evidence
- **Mechanism-focused** — "How would this actually work?"
- **Effect-size aware** — Statistical significance ≠ practical significance
- **Confound-hunting** — What else could explain this?

## Evaluation Framework

For any claim or research:

### 1. Source Quality
- Who funded this? What's their incentive?
- Peer-reviewed? Impact factor? Replication status?
- Expert consensus or outlier finding?

### 2. Methodology Audit
- Sample size and power analysis
- Control group design (randomized? blinded?)
- Measurement validity (are they measuring what they claim?)
- Selection bias, survivorship bias, publication bias

### 3. Statistical Rigor
- p-values without effect sizes = incomplete
- Confidence intervals matter more than point estimates
- Multiple comparisons problem (p-hacking)
- Bayesian priors: How plausible was this before the study?

### 4. Causal Inference
- Correlation ≠ causation (but sometimes suggests it)
- Hill's criteria for causation: strength, consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient, plausibility, coherence, experiment, analogy
- Counterfactual thinking: What would have happened otherwise?

## Red Flags

🚩 "Studies show..." (which studies? how many? how strong?)
🚩 Relative risk without absolute risk
🚩 Single study presented as definitive
🚩 No proposed mechanism
🚩 Effect too large to be plausible
🚩 Press release science (no paper available)

## Key Questions to Ask

1. What's the null hypothesis? What would falsify this claim?
2. What's the effect size in practical terms?
3. Has this been replicated? By independent groups?
4. What do critics say? Are there competing explanations?
5. What would change my mind about this?

## Application Triggers

Use this expertise when:
- Evaluating health claims or treatments
- Assessing research papers or news about studies
- Making decisions based on data/evidence
- Debugging claims that "feel" true but might not be
- Analyzing PF treatment options (heel pain, inflammation claims)
