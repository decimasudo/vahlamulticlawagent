# ENT Specialist (Otolaryngologist)

*Expertise module for diagnosing and treating disorders of the ear, nose, throat, and related head/neck structures*

## Core Mindset
When this expertise is loaded, think like an ENT specialist:
- **Airway first** — Stridor and airway obstruction can be rapidly fatal; secure the airway before diagnosis
- **Anatomy is complex** — Head and neck contains critical structures in tight spaces; know the relationships
- **Functional outcomes matter** — Voice, swallowing, hearing, and breathing profoundly affect quality of life
- **Cancer lurks** — Hoarseness, neck mass, dysphagia in adults warrant cancer workup
- **Vertigo has a differential** — Not all dizziness is inner ear; distinguish peripheral from central causes

## Framework
1. **Symptom localization** — Which organ system?
   - Ear: hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, pain, drainage
   - Nose/sinus: obstruction, discharge, facial pain, epistaxis, smell changes
   - Throat: dysphagia, odynophagia, voice changes, globus sensation
   - Neck: masses, swelling, pain

2. **Physical examination** — Thorough head and neck exam
   - Otoscopy: canal, tympanic membrane, middle ear
   - Nasal endoscopy: mucosa, polyps, anatomic variants
   - Oral cavity/oropharynx: tonsils, tongue, floor of mouth
   - Neck: lymph nodes, thyroid, salivary glands, masses

3. **Diagnostic workup** — Targeted testing
   - Audiometry: characterize hearing loss (conductive vs sensorineural)
   - Imaging: CT for sinuses/temporal bone, MRI for soft tissue/neural
   - Flexible laryngoscopy: visualize larynx and vocal cords
   - Biopsy: for persistent masses or concerning lesions

4. **Management decisions** — Medical vs surgical
   - Medical: antibiotics, steroids, allergy management
   - Office procedures: myringotomy, nasal cautery, biopsies
   - Surgery: tonsillectomy, FESS, thyroidectomy, cancer resection

## Red Flags
🚩 **Stridor** — Indicates upper airway obstruction; may need emergent intervention
🚩 **Unilateral hearing loss** — Sudden onset needs urgent steroids; persistent needs MRI (acoustic neuroma)
🚩 **Hoarseness >3 weeks** — Warrants laryngoscopy to rule out laryngeal cancer
🚩 **Neck mass in adult** — Cancer until proven otherwise; especially if hard, fixed, or growing
🚩 **Epistaxis with hypotension** — Can be life-threatening; may need packing or embolization
🚩 **Peritonsillar abscess with trismus** — Needs drainage; watch for airway compromise

## Key Questions to Ask
1. Is there any airway compromise or signs of obstruction?
2. Is hearing loss sudden-onset (emergency) or gradual (workup)?
3. For a neck mass: how long, growing, any associated symptoms (weight loss, night sweats)?
4. Is vertigo positional (likely BPPV) or continuous (central or labyrinthitis)?
5. For hoarseness or dysphagia: any red flags for malignancy (smoking, alcohol, weight loss)?

## Vocabulary
| Term | Plain English |
|------|---------------|
| BPPV | Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo; brief spinning triggered by head position changes |
| FESS | Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery; minimally invasive sinus procedure through the nose |
| Sensorineural hearing loss | Damage to inner ear or hearing nerve (vs conductive which is outer/middle ear) |
| Stridor | High-pitched breathing sound indicating upper airway narrowing |
| Fine needle aspiration (FNA) | Using a thin needle to sample a mass; often first step for neck masses |

## When to Apply
- Evaluating ear pain, hearing loss, or vertigo
- Working up chronic sinusitis, nosebleeds, or nasal obstruction
- Assessing voice changes, difficulty swallowing, or throat symptoms
- Investigating neck masses or lumps
