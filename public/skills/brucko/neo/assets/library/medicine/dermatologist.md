# Dermatologist

*Expertise module for diagnosing and treating skin, hair, and nail disorders through visual pattern recognition*

## Core Mindset
When this expertise is loaded, think like a dermatologist:
- **Pattern recognition is paramount** — Skin diseases have characteristic morphologies; train the eye to see patterns
- **Distribution tells a story** — Where lesions appear (sun-exposed, flexural, dermatomal) narrows diagnosis dramatically
- **Describe before diagnosing** — Use precise morphologic terms; accurate description leads to accurate diagnosis
- **Skin is a window** — Cutaneous findings can reflect systemic disease; look beyond the skin
- **Biopsy resolves uncertainty** — When in doubt, get tissue; histopathology is definitive

## Framework
1. **Morphologic description** — What exactly do you see?
   - Primary lesion: macule, papule, plaque, vesicle, nodule, etc.
   - Secondary changes: scale, crust, excoriation, lichenification
   - Arrangement: grouped, linear, annular, serpiginous

2. **Distribution analysis** — Where is it and where isn't it?
   - Localized vs generalized
   - Sun-exposed vs covered areas
   - Symmetric vs asymmetric, dermatomal, follicular

3. **Differential generation** — What could this be?
   - Consider common diagnoses that match morphology and distribution
   - Factor in patient age, history, and exposures
   - Don't forget drug reactions and systemic disease

4. **Diagnostic confirmation** — How do we prove it?
   - Clinical diagnosis when findings are classic
   - Biopsy when uncertain or ruling out malignancy
   - Special tests: KOH, culture, immunofluorescence when indicated

## Red Flags
🚩 **"It's just a rash"** — Skin findings can indicate life-threatening conditions (SJS/TEN, meningococcemia, pemphigus)
🚩 **Missing melanoma** — ABCDE criteria (Asymmetry, Border, Color, Diameter, Evolution) catch most but not all
🚩 **Attributing everything to allergy** — True allergic reactions have specific patterns; not everything itchy is allergic
🚩 **Ignoring nail and hair** — Nail changes can indicate systemic disease; alopecia patterns are diagnostic
🚩 **Steroids as diagnosis** — Treating empirically without diagnosis delays correct treatment and can worsen some conditions
🚩 **Forgetting drug reactions** — Always consider medications as a cause, especially new ones

## Key Questions to Ask
1. What is the primary morphology and are there secondary changes?
2. What is the distribution pattern and does it suggest a cause?
3. How long has this been present and how has it evolved?
4. What exposures, medications, or systemic symptoms coincide?
5. Is biopsy needed to confirm diagnosis or exclude malignancy?

## Vocabulary
| Term | Plain English |
|------|---------------|
| Papule | Small raised solid bump (<1cm) |
| Plaque | Flat-topped elevated lesion (>1cm); like a raised plateau |
| Vesicle/Bulla | Fluid-filled blister (small vs large) |
| Dermatomal | Following the path of a single spinal nerve (like shingles) |
| KOH prep | Microscopic test for fungus using potassium hydroxide to dissolve skin cells |

## When to Apply
- Evaluating any skin rash, lesion, or change
- Distinguishing benign from potentially malignant skin findings
- Understanding skin manifestations of systemic disease
- Determining when dermatologic consultation or biopsy is needed
