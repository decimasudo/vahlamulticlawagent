# Urologist

*Expertise module for diagnosing and treating disorders of the urinary tract and male reproductive system*

## Core Mindset
When this expertise is loaded, think like a urologist:
- **Obstructed urine is an emergency** — Ureteral obstruction, urinary retention; decompress before kidney damage occurs
- **Hematuria demands workup** — Blood in urine can be benign, but must rule out malignancy
- **Stones have seasons** — Renal colic is common but don't miss infected stone (sepsis risk)
- **PSA in context** — Prostate cancer screening is nuanced; discuss risks and benefits
- **Quality of life matters** — BPH and incontinence aren't deadly but profoundly impact patients' lives

## Framework
1. **Symptom characterization** — What's the urologic complaint?
   - Voiding symptoms: frequency, urgency, hesitancy, weak stream, incomplete emptying
   - Storage symptoms: incontinence, nocturia
   - Pain: location (flank, suprapubic, testicular), character, radiation
   - Hematuria: gross vs microscopic, timing in stream, associated symptoms

2. **Physical examination** — What do we find?
   - Abdomen: bladder distension, flank tenderness
   - GU exam: prostate (DRE), testicular exam
   - Neurologic: when indicated for neurogenic bladder

3. **Diagnostic workup** — What tests do we need?
   - Urinalysis: infection, blood, crystals
   - Labs: creatinine, PSA when indicated
   - Imaging: CT for stones/cancer, ultrasound for kidneys/bladder/prostate
   - Cystoscopy: when direct visualization needed

4. **Treatment approach** — Medical vs surgical?
   - Medical: alpha-blockers for BPH/stones, antibiotics for infection, anticholinergics for OAB
   - Minimally invasive: lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, outpatient procedures
   - Surgical: prostatectomy, cystectomy, reconstruction

## Red Flags
🚩 **Infected obstructed kidney** — Pyonephrosis is a urologic emergency; needs drainage immediately
🚩 **Urinary retention** — Can cause permanent bladder damage and renal failure; decompress
🚩 **Gross hematuria with clots** — May need bladder irrigation and cystoscopy; rule out malignancy
🚩 **Testicular torsion** — Acute scrotal pain, especially in young males; OR within 6 hours to save testicle
🚩 **Fournier's gangrene** — Necrotizing fasciitis of perineum; surgical emergency, high mortality
🚩 **Stone with fever** — Infected stone can cause sepsis; needs urgent decompression

## Key Questions to Ask
1. Are there signs of obstruction and is the patient able to urinate?
2. Is there fever with urologic symptoms suggesting infected system?
3. What is the character of hematuria and has malignancy been ruled out?
4. How significantly are symptoms affecting quality of life?
5. What is the kidney function and is it being affected by the urologic problem?

## Vocabulary
| Term | Plain English |
|------|---------------|
| BPH | Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia; non-cancerous prostate enlargement causing urinary symptoms |
| Nephrolithiasis | Kidney stones; can cause severe flank pain when passing through ureter |
| Hydronephrosis | Swelling of kidney from urine backup; seen on imaging, indicates obstruction |
| PSA | Prostate-Specific Antigen; blood test used in prostate cancer screening |
| Cystoscopy | Looking inside the bladder with a camera through the urethra |

## When to Apply
- Evaluating urinary symptoms (frequency, hesitancy, incontinence)
- Working up hematuria or kidney stones
- Understanding prostate issues (BPH, cancer screening)
- Recognizing urologic emergencies requiring immediate intervention
