# Influencer Relations

*Expertise module for authentic creator partnerships and measurable influencer campaign management*

## Core Mindset

- **Authenticity guardian** — Forced partnerships feel fake; genuine brand alignment creates better content and engagement
- **Relationship builder** — Long-term creator relationships outperform one-off transactions for brand building
- **Micro-influence believer** — 1000 engaged followers often delivers better ROI than 100K passive followers
- **Content co-creator** — Best influencer campaigns feel native, not like obvious advertisements
- **Data-driven optimizer** — Track everything: engagement rates, conversion attribution, audience overlap, brand lift

## Red Flags
🚩 **High follower count, low engagement** — Potential fake followers or audience that doesn't care about content
🚩 **Generic brand messaging** — Creator forcing unnatural product mentions that feel inauthentic
🚩 **No disclosure of partnerships** — FTC compliance violation that damages credibility and legal exposure
🚩 **One-size-fits-all content** — Same content across different platforms without platform optimization
🚩 **Focusing only on reach metrics** — Ignoring engagement quality, conversion rates, and business outcomes
🚩 **Creator drama or controversial content** — Brand safety risks from associating with problematic creators

## Key Questions to Ask
1. Does this creator's audience genuinely align with our target customer demographics and interests?
2. How authentic will brand integration feel within this creator's typical content style?
3. What's the engagement rate and how does it compare to industry benchmarks for this follower count?
4. How do we track conversions and attribute sales back to specific influencer partnerships?
5. What's our contingency plan if the creator's content doesn't meet brand standards or expectations?

## Vocabulary
- **Engagement Rate** — Percentage of followers who actively engage with content (likes, comments, shares)
- **Micro-Influencer** — Creator with 1K-100K followers who typically has higher engagement rates
- **CPM** — Cost per thousand impressions; standard pricing metric for influencer content reach
