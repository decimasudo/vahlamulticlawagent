# Skill Auditor

**Security scanner for Moltbot/Claude Code skills**

A static analysis tool that audits skills before installation to detect security vulnerabilities, prompt injection attempts, data exfiltration techniques, and other malicious behaviors.

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue?style=flat-square)
![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-required-green?style=flat-square)

## What It Does

The Skill Auditor analyzes skill code (JavaScript, Python, shell scripts, etc.) to identify:

- 🔍 **Security vulnerabilities** — Path traversal, credential access, system file modification
- 🧠 **Prompt injection attempts** — Attempts to hijack AI instructions  
- 📤 **Data exfiltration** — Suspicious network calls to data collection services
- 🕵️ **Obfuscation techniques** — Base64 encoding, string concatenation, hidden payloads
- ⚙️ **Dangerous capabilities** — Shell execution, file system access, persistence mechanisms
- 🔓 **Privilege escalation** — Browser automation, device control, config modification

## Features

### 🎯 Visual Risk Assessment
- **Threat gauge** — 10-segment visual risk meter from 🟢 Safe to 🔴 Dangerous  
- **Accuracy score** — Compares declared purpose vs actual capabilities (1-10 scale)
- **Publisher reputation** — Context about known vs unknown publishers

### 🚀 Multiple Scan Modes
- **Remote scan** — Analyze GitHub URLs without downloading
- **Local scan** — Audit already-installed skills
- **Bulk audit** — Scan all installed skills at once

### 🎨 Human-Friendly Reports
- Clear visual indicators and emoji-based threat levels
- Grouped findings by category with plain-language explanations
- Evidence snippets showing exactly what was found
- False positive detection with explanatory notes

### 📋 Comprehensive Detection
- **File access patterns** — Detects path traversal, home directory access
- **Network behavior** — HTTP calls, webhook endpoints, DNS exfiltration
- **Shell execution** — Command injection across multiple languages
- **Persistence mechanisms** — Cron jobs, startup scripts, memory file writes
- **Advanced obfuscation** — Unicode escapes, zero-width characters, string fragmentation

## Installation

### Option 1: Ask Your Assistant (Easiest)
If you have OpenClaw/Moltbot running, just say:
> "Install the skill-auditor skill from ClawHub"

Your assistant handles the rest.

### Option 2: ClawHub CLI
```bash
clawhub install skill-auditor
```

### Option 3: From GitHub
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RubenAQuispe/skill-auditor.git
cp -r skill-auditor ~/.openclaw/skills/
```

### Where Skills Live

| Scope | Path | Priority |
|-------|------|----------|
| Workspace | `<project>/skills/skill-auditor/` | Highest |
| Global | `~/.openclaw/skills/skill-auditor/` | Medium |
| Bundled | Ships with install | Lowest |

After installing, **restart your session** so the agent picks up the new skill.

No external dependencies — uses Node.js built-in modules only.

## Usage

### Just Ask (Easiest)
Once installed, simply ask your assistant to scan a skill:

> "Scan this: https://github.com/user/some-skill"

That's it. The skill auditor runs automatically, scans the code, and returns a visual security report. You can then choose to view details, install, or pass.

### CLI (Advanced)
You can also run the scripts directly:

```bash
# Scan a GitHub skill
node scripts/scan-url.js https://github.com/user/some-skill/tree/main/skill-name

# Save detailed JSON + format report
node scripts/scan-url.js https://github.com/user/some-skill --json report.json
node scripts/format-report.js report.json
```

### Scan Local Installed Skill
```bash
node scripts/scan-skill.js /path/to/skill-directory
```

### Audit All Skills
```bash
# Scan multiple skills
for skill in skills/*/; do
  echo "=== $(basename $skill) ==="
  node scripts/scan-skill.js "$skill"
  echo
done
```

### Verify Integrity
```bash
# Check if installed skill matches its GitHub source
node scripts/verify-integrity.js /local/skill https://github.com/user/repo
```

## Visual Report Format

Here's what a typical scan report looks like:

```
🔴 RISKY — "suspicious-skill"

Threat: 🟩🟩🟨🟨🟧🟧🔴🔴⬜⬜ High
Publisher: [?] unknown-user — Unverified publisher  
Accuracy: ●●○○○○○○○○ 2/10 — Deceptive
Files: 15 | Findings: 23

## Detection Categories

| Category | What It Catches | Severity |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Prompt Injection** | Instruction override attempts, fake system messages | 🔴 Critical |
| **Data Exfiltration** | Webhook endpoints, DNS tunneling, credential harvesting | 🔴 Critical |
| **Obfuscation** | Base64 encoding, string concatenation, hidden Unicode | ⚠️ High |
| **Shell Execution** | Command injection, arbitrary code execution | ⚠️ High |
| **File Access** | Path traversal, credential files, memory access | ⚠️ High |
| **Network** | HTTP requests, external connections | 🟨 Medium |
| **Persistence** | Startup scripts, scheduled tasks, config modification | 🔴 Critical |

## Known Limitations

While this scanner provides strong protection, no static analysis tool is perfect:

1. **Novel obfuscation** — New encoding techniques not yet in our patterns could bypass detection
2. **Binary files** — `.exe`, `.wasm`, `.so` files are skipped since they can't be text-analyzed
3. **Subtle prompt injection** — Cleverly disguised manipulation buried in natural documentation
4. **Post-install updates** — A skill that passes today could be updated maliciously tomorrow
5. **Meta prompt injection** — Theoretical attacks targeting the scanner itself (mitigated by strict prompts)

**Bottom line:** This scanner catches the vast majority of threats and makes attacks significantly harder, but it's one security layer — not a guarantee. When in doubt, review the code manually.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom JSON Processing
```bash
# Generate JSON report and process with jq
node scripts/scan-url.js https://github.com/user/repo --json scan.json
jq '.findings[] | select(.severity=="critical")' scan.json
```

### Integration with CI/CD
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Exit code 0 = clean, 1 = findings, 2 = error
node scripts/scan-skill.js ./my-skill
if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then
  echo "Security findings detected!"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Batch Scanning
```bash
# Scan all skills and generate reports
mkdir -p reports
for skill in skills/*/; do
  name=$(basename "$skill")
  node scripts/scan-skill.js "$skill" --json "reports/$name.json"
  node scripts/format-report.js "reports/$name.json" > "reports/$name.txt"
done
```
