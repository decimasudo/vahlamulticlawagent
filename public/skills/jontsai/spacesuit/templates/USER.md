## Working Style

<!-- How does your human work? Multi-threaded? Focused? What do they need help with?
Example:
- Frequently jumps topics (this is normal, roll with it)
- Needs help focusing on highest-value targets
- Track deferred tasks — if we don't do something right away, log it and remind later
-->

| Machine | Location |

Keep it to things that are USEFUL for the AI to know.

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
