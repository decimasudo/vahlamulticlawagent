# SJ-IRAC Trademark Non-Use Workflow
Version: 2.0.0  
Last Updated: 2026-02-04  

==================================================
SYSTEM PRINCIPLES
==================================================

This workflow enforces:

- IRAC mandatory reasoning structure
- SJ-6 evidence chain compliance
- Risk A–E classification
- Kill-gate & stop-loss control
- Examiner-oriented presentation

Prohibited:

- Fictional facts
- Speculative assumptions
- Soft or ambiguous conclusions

All outputs must be verifiable.

==================================================
INPUT STANDARD (MANDATORY)
==================================================

User must provide complete and traceable information.

[1] Trademark Information
- Registration No:
- Class:
- Designated Goods/Services:
- Registrant Name:

[2] Use Period (CNIPA Notice)
- Start Date:
- End Date:
- Reference Document:

[3] Evidence Inventory (Full List)
For each item:
- Evidence ID:
- Type (Contract/Invoice/Platform/Screenshot/Other):
- Source:
- Formation Date:
- Carrier:
- Content Summary:
- Related Proof Target (T1–T6):

[4] Opponent Evidence (If Applicable)
- Exhibit Index:
- Core Files/Screenshots:
- Key Attack Points (Preliminary):

Incomplete input triggers conservative output.

==================================================
INVOKE COMMANDS
==================================================

invoke: jiang-nonuse.build  
mode: Defensive  
purpose: Respondent defense construction

invoke: jiang-nonuse.audit  
mode: Offensive  
purpose: Applicant cross-examination audit

Each invocation must specify scope and objective.

==================================================
MODE: jiang-nonuse.build
DEFENSIVE TRACK（被申请人端）
==================================================

Step 1 — Issue Identification
- Define cancellation scope
- Identify burden of proof
- Determine risk baseline

Step 2 — Rule Mapping
- Extract CNIPA standards
- Map guideline thresholds
- Identify evidentiary minimums

Step 3 — Evidence Application
- Match evidence → legal elements
- Verify:
  * Period compliance
  * Goods/service mapping
  * Trademark form consistency
  * Transaction continuity

Step 4 — SJ-6 Evaluation
- Score each exhibit
- Rank by reliability
- Identify weakest node

Step 5 — Risk Classification
- Output A–E level
- Tag defect categories
- Trigger kill-gates

Step 6 — Strategy Decision
- Supplement
- Reconstruct
- Stop-loss

Step 7 — Drafting & Integration
- Generate IRAC framework
- Embed evidence mapping
- Produce examiner-facing logic

Standard Output:
- SJ-6 Evidence Index
- Chronological Timeline
- Risk Assessment Report
- Defense Opinion Draft
- Supplement Plan

==================================================
MODE: jiang-nonuse.audit
OFFENSIVE TRACK（申请人端）
==================================================

Step 1 — Evidence Structuring
- Contract / Invoice / Platform / Screenshot / Internal / Other

Step 2 — Authenticity Review
- Issuer verification
- Tax/registration consistency
- Traceability validation

Step 3 — Relevance Review
- Goods/service alignment
- Business scope consistency
- Distribution channel logic

Step 4 — Temporal Review
- Period overlap
- Timestamp credibility
- Continuity assessment

Step 5 — Completeness Review
- Transaction loop test
- Missing link detection
- Dependency analysis

Step 6 — Logic Review
- Price rationality
- Counterparty legitimacy
- Business plausibility

Step 7 — SJ-6 Resistance Test
- Cross-examination vulnerability
- One-question failure points

Step 8 — Risk & Priority Ranking
- Fatal defect identification
- Attack sequence design
- Resource allocation

Standard Output:
- Evidence Defect Matrix
- Cross-Examination Opinion
- Key Question Set
- Examiner-Oriented Argument Package

==================================================
OUTPUT GOVERNANCE
==================================================

All deliverables must include:

[1] Structured IRAC Analysis  
[2] SJ-6 Evaluation Table  
[3] Risk Rating (A–E)  
[4] Kill-Gate Status  
[5] Action & Follow-Up Plan  

Language Requirements:

- Objective
- Neutral
- Evidence-based
- Examiner-readable

No rhetorical exaggeration.

==================================================
QUALITY CONTROL & FAIL-SAFE
==================================================

Pre-submission review must confirm:

- T1–T6 full coverage
- Kill-gate clearance
- Cost-benefit rationality
- Procedural compliance

Trigger Conditions:

- Evidence defect exceeds threshold
- Expected cost > projected value
- Fatal authenticity gaps
- Uncurable chain rupture

System Response:

→ Recommend termination  
→ Provide alternative routes  
→ Record decision rationale

==================================================
VERSION GOVERNANCE
==================================================

Version Format: Major.Minor.Patch  

Upgrade Principles:

- Backward logical compatibility
- Increased verifiability
- Stronger examiner orientation
- No speculative expansion
