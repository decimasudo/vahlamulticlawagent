# SJ-IRAC Non-Use Engine（撤三证据推理系统）

Professional Release v2.0.0  
Author: Jiang Zhongling（商标蒋道理）  
Organization: Nantong Zhongnan Quansheng IP Co., Ltd.  
Last Updated: 2026-02-04

## 1. System Positioning

SJ-IRAC Non-Use Engine is a professional-grade evidence reasoning and document production system for CNIPA 3-year non-use cancellation proceedings.

This system is designed to produce examiner-oriented, period-centered, legally structured defense and cross-examination outputs.

Core Objective:

Transform scattered evidence into a continuous, verifiable, legally sufficient use chain.

---

## 2. Problems Addressed

This system focuses on eliminating decisive failure causes in non-use cases:

- Fragmented period coverage  
- Time-segment discontinuity  
- Evidence–period mismatch  
- Unmapped proof elements  
- Pseudo-commercial transactions  
- Weak examiner persuasion  

---

## 3. System Architecture
Core Principle:

Period → Evidence → Elements → Logic → Risk → Decision → Document

---

## 4. Legal & Evidence Constitution

### 4.1 Applicable Law

- PRC Trademark Law (2019)
- Implementing Regulations
- CNIPA Guidelines
- Nice Classification

Trademark use must satisfy:

- Real commercial activity
- Public market exposure
- Verifiable records
- Continuous within period
- Linked to designated goods/services

---

### 4.2 No-Fabrication Rule

Prohibited:

- Invented transactions
- Fabricated invoices/contracts
- Backdated materials
- Editable screenshots
- Narrative-only statements

Each exhibit must show:

Source / Date / Carrier / Proof Purpose

---

### 4.3 SJ-6 Evidence Chain

All exhibits are evaluated by:

1. Authenticity  
2. Relevance  
3. Completeness  
4. Temporal Validity  
5. Logical Consistency  
6. Resistance  

Non-qualified items are excluded.

---

### 4.4 Core Proof Targets (T1–T6)

| Code | Target |
|------|--------|
| T1 | User identity |
| T2 | Mark form |
| T3 | Goods/services |
| T4 | Time / Period |
| T5 | Commercial context |
| T6 | Transaction loop |

Missing targets → mandatory risk escalation.

---

### 4.5 Designated Period Control Rule（指定期间控制规则）

All defense outputs must demonstrate continuous commercial use within the designated three-year period.

Mandatory segmentation:

P1: First 12 months  
P2: Middle 12 months  
P3: Last 12 months  

Rules:

- Each segment must contain ≥1 valid commercial-use proof
- Any empty segment triggers G1 escalation
- Two or more empty segments → fatal defect

Zero-gap continuity is the primary examination anchor.

---

### 4.6 Period–Element Binding Rule

Each exhibit must be mapped as:

Date → Period Segment → T4 → Goods → Mark → Transaction

Unmapped evidence = invalid.

---

## 5. Workflow Architecture (SJ-REVOKE OS)

### Phase 0 — Admission
Feasibility + Cost + Period Risk

### Phase 1 — Inventory
Registration + Period Segmentation + SJ-6

### Phase 2 — Chaining
Period → Transaction → Mark → Goods

### Phase 3 — Risk Audit
Period / Subject / Mapping / Authenticity

### Phase 4 — Strategy
Reinforce / Supplement / Stop-loss

### Phase 5 — Drafting
Period-driven automation

### Phase 6 — QC
Continuity + Readability

### Phase 7 — Archive
Review + Reuse

No skipping permitted.

---

## 6. Risk & Stop-Loss Engine

### 6.1 Risk Levels

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| A | Full period coverage + strong loop |
| B | Minor gaps, repairable |
| C | Partial period missing |
| D | Structural weakness |
| E | Fatal discontinuity |

---

### 6.2 Kill Gates

- G1 Period fatal
- G2 Goods fatal
- G3 Mark fatal
- G4 Subject fatal
- G5 Chain fatal
- G6 Authenticity fatal

---

### 6.3 Output

Each case outputs:

Decision + Level + Period Map + Risk Points + Actions

---

## 7. Dual-Track System

### 7.1 Defensive Track（被申请人端）

Goal:

Period continuity + Closed commercial loop

Minimum Chain:

Mark + Goods + Period + Transaction

---

### 7.2 Offensive Track（申请人端）

Focus:

Break period continuity and element linkage

Priority:

Time → Subject → Goods → Loop → Authenticity

---

## 8. Evidence Index Standard (SJ-6 Mandatory)

### 8.1 Binding Rule

All submissions must include a Period-Mapped SJ-6 Index.

---

### 8.2 Mandatory Fields

1. ID  
2. Name  
3. Source  
4. Date  
5. Period Segment  
6. Goods  
7. Target  
8. SJ-6  
9. Pages  
10. Risk  

---

### 8.3 Template

| ID | Name | Date | Period | Goods | Target | SJ6 | Pages | Risk |
|----|------|------|--------|-------|--------|-----|-------|------|

---

### 8.4 Grouping

- P1 Evidence
- P2 Evidence
- P3 Evidence

All mandatory.

---

## 9. Standard Deliverables

| Item | Must Include |
|------|--------------|
| Period Matrix | Yes |
| Timeline | Yes |
| Risk Map | Yes |
| IRAC | Yes |
| Draft | Yes |

No partial submission.

---
