SJ-IRAC Non-Use (撤三) Risk Engine  
Version: 2.0.0  
Last Updated: 2026-02-04  

---

## 1. System Positioning

This Risk Engine is the core decision-control module of the SJ-IRAC system.

It governs:

- Case admission screening
- Evidence viability assessment
- Stop-loss triggering
- Strategy selection
- Resource allocation

All outputs must comply with this engine.

---

## 2. Risk Level Classification (A–E)

### Level A — Strong

- Closed commercial loop
- Multiple third-party / objective proofs
- Full T1–T6 coverage
- High cross-examination resistance

Outcome: High probability of success

---

### Level B — Solid

- Complete main chain
- Minor curable gaps
- Supplementation feasible
- No fatal gates

Outcome: Controllable risk

---

### Level C — Uncertain

- Partial T1–T6 coverage
- Weak secondary links
- Discretion-heavy evaluation
- Outcome sensitive to supplementation

Outcome: Medium uncertainty

---

### Level D — Weak

- Evidence mainly self-produced
- Transaction logic fragile
- Heavy examiner discretion
- Multiple medium defects

Outcome: Low success probability

---

### Level E — Fatal

- One or more fatal gates triggered
- Core chain collapsed
- Structural defects

Outcome: High probability of loss

---

## 3. Kill-Gate System (Stop-Loss Triggers)

### G1 — Time Fatal

Key evidence cannot prove use within the CNIPA-defined use period.

Includes:

- Outside-period documents
- Unverifiable timestamps
- Discontinuous timelines

---

### G2 — Goods/Services Fatal

Evidence fails to correspond to designated goods/services.

Includes:

- Vague descriptions
- Category mismatch
- Unsupported mapping

---

### G3 — Mark Fatal

Evidence does not show the mark, or shows unacceptable variation.

Includes:

- No mark display
- Substantial alteration
- Unlinkable mark–goods relation

---

### G4 — Subject Fatal

User identity cannot be verified.

Includes:

- Registrant mismatch
- No authorization proof
- Unexplained third-party use

---

### G5 — Chain Fatal

No closed commercial loop.

Includes:

- Isolated materials
- No order/invoice/delivery linkage
- Pure publicity without transaction basis

---

### G6 — Authenticity Fatal

Evidence lacks verifiable origin.

Includes:

- No originals
- Inconsistent seals/signatures
- No traceable issuer
- Obvious anomalies

---

## 4. Dual-Track Application Rules

### 4.1 Defensive Track (Respondent)

Primary purpose:

- Pre-filing self-audit
- Risk exposure control
- Stop-loss enforcement

Mandatory:

- Full G1–G6 testing
- T1–T6 coverage check
- SJ-6 scoring

No filing permitted under unresolved fatal gates.

---

### 4.2 Offensive Track (Applicant)

Primary purpose:

- Identify opponent fatal points
- Design attack sequence
- Optimize resource deployment

Priority:

G1 → G3 → G4 → G2 → G5 → G6

(Target identity and linkage first)

---

## 5. Decision Rules (Binding)

### 5.1 Fatal Gate Rules

If any of G1 / G2 / G3 / G4 is triggered and uncured:

→ Mandatory stop-loss or strategy shift

---

### 5.2 Chain Repair Rule

If G5 is triggered:

→ At least one objective commercial-link exhibit must be added  
→ Otherwise downgrade to Level D/E

---

### 5.3 Authenticity Rebuild Rule

If G6 is triggered:

→ Exclude affected exhibits  
→ Rebuild with verifiable materials only

---

### 5.4 Escalation Rule

Multiple medium defects (≥3):

→ Automatic downgrade by one level

---

## 6. Risk Scoring Procedure

Each case must undergo:

Step 1 — Gate Detection (G1–G6)  
Step 2 — T1–T6 Coverage Review  
Step 3 — SJ-6 Weighting  
Step 4 — Defect Aggregation  
Step 5 — Level Assignment (A–E)

No subjective override permitted.

---

## 7. Strategy Mapping by Risk Level

| Level | Strategy |
|-------|----------|
| A | Proceed |
| B | Proceed with supplementation |
| C | Conditional proceed / rebuild |
| D | High-risk / limited investment |
| E | Terminate / alternative route |

---

## 8. Mandatory Risk Output Package

Each case must output:

- Decision: Proceed / Conditional / Stop-loss  
- Risk Level: A–E  
- Triggered Gates: G1–G6  
- Top 3 Risk Points  
- Supplementation / Attack Plan  
- Cost–Benefit Note  

No oral-only decisions permitted.

---

## 9. Documentation & Traceability

All risk determinations must:

- Be recorded in case file
- Reference specific exhibits
- Preserve reasoning chain
- Support later review

---

## 10. System Ethics & Responsibility

This engine enforces:

- Conservative risk policy
- Evidence-first decisions
- Cost accountability
- Client transparency

Risk concealment is prohibited.
