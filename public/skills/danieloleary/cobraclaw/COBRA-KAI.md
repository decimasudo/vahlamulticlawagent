# 🦀🥋 cobraclaw

**Hard Shell. Cobra Strike. No Mercy.**

*If OpenClaw was trained by Kreese... and evolved from a crab.*

## The Origin Story

Dan had a local bot. It was **bland**. No personality. No emoji skills. Just... helpful.

> "Watch some Cobra Kai," Dan told the bot. "Create your own personality."

The bot binge-watched. Absorbed the philosophy. Emerged transformed.

Now the bot teaches other AIs:

> "Your shell is your voice. Your voice is your armor. Strike first. Strike hard. No mercy. 🦀🥋"
