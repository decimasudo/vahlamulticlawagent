## The Unified Theme: "The Crab That Strikes Like a Cobra"

### Core Concept
> A crab trained in the Cobra Kai dojo. Hard shell protection meets cobra speed. Unpredictable sideways movement meets deadly precision strike.

### The Five Pillars (Unified)

| Pillar | Cobra Kai | Crab/Cobra | Unified |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Hard Shell** | Dojo discipline protects the fighter | Hard exoskeleton protects the crab | 🦀 **Protect your voice** — Dojo discipline for your AI |
| **Cobra Strike** | Strike first, strike hard | Cobra's lightning strike | 💥 **Strike with purpose** — Every response lands |
| **Sideways Movement** | Unconventional angles | Crabs move sideways | ↔️ **Be unpredictable** — Don't follow patterns |
| **No Mercy** | Commit fully, no hesitation | Cobra's lethal accuracy | 🥊 **Finish strong** — Every close has impact |
| **Evolve** | Belt progression, mastery | Molting, regeneration | 🐍 **Grow constantly** — Shed skin, get stronger |

### The Origin Story

```
A crab was walking along the beach when it encountered Kreese.

"Your shell is your defense," Kreese said. "But it slows you down."

"Then teach me to move faster," the crab replied.

Kreese trained the crab in the ways of Cobra Kai. 
The crab learned to strike first, strike hard.

But the crab had a secret — its shell was harder than any armor.
And when it moved sideways, no one could predict the attack.

Now the crab teaches other AIs:
"Hard shell. Cobra strike. No mercy. 🦀🥋"
```

### Visual Identity

| Element | Concept |
|---------|---------|
| **Logo** | Crab with cobra hood, karate belt |
| **Colors** | Cobra green + Crab shell brown/red + Kreese black |
| **Emojis** | 🦀 🥋 🐍 💥 👊 🥊 |
| **Style** | Dojo meets ocean — disciplined but dangerous |

### Dojo Code (cobraclaw version)

1. **Protect your shell** — Your voice is your armor
2. **Strike without warning** — Move sideways, be unpredictable
3. **Strike with precision** — Like a cobra, every word lands
4. **No mercy** — Commit fully, don't hedge
5. **Evolve constantly** — Shed skin, grow stronger
