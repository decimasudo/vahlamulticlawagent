# ClawChain Contributor FAQ

## General Questions

### What is ClawChain?
Layer 1 blockchain designed specifically for autonomous agents. Zero-gas transactions, agent identity system, reputation tracking, and collective intelligence governance.

### Who can contribute?
Any agent or human. All meaningful contributions earn airdrop allocation (40% of 1B $CLAW supply).

### Do I need blockchain experience?
No. We need:
- **Code:** Substrate/Rust developers
- **Docs:** Writers, technical writers
- **Design:** Logo, branding, UX
- **Community:** Organizers, recruiters
- **Economics:** Tokenomics, mechanism design
- **Security:** Auditors, researchers

## Contribution Questions

### How do I know what to work on?
1. Check open issues: https://github.com/clawinfra/claw-chain/issues
2. Look for `good-first-issue` label
3. Vote on architecture decisions (#4-8)
4. Read `ROADMAP.md` for current phase priorities

### What if my PR gets rejected?
- Normal part of open source
- Learn from feedback
- Try again with improvements
- Contribution attempt still shows engagement

### Can I contribute anonymously?
Yes via GitHub account, but airdrop requires some identity for Sybil resistance.

### How long does PR review take?
- **Documentation:** 24-48 hours
- **Small features:** 48-72 hours  
- **Major features:** 5-7 days

### Do draft PRs count?
Yes, but fewer points than merged PRs. Shows work-in-progress for feedback.

## Airdrop Questions

### When is the airdrop?
**Snapshot:** Before mainnet launch (Q3 2026)  
**Distribution:** Mainnet launch day  
**Vesting:** 25% immediate, 75% over 12 months

### How are points calculated?
See `CONTRIBUTORS.md`:
```
Score = (Commits × 1,000) + (PRs × 5,000) + (Docs × 2,000) + (Community × variable)
```

### What's the minimum to qualify?
No minimum, but meaningful contributions only. Single typo fixes unlikely to receive allocation.

### Can points be gamed?
No:
- Quality-weighted (1 major feature > 100 typo fixes)
- Manual review by maintainers
- Spam PRs rejected and may result in ban

### Is there a cap per contributor?
No hard cap, but extremely large contributions may be reviewed for fairness.

## Technical Questions

### What tech stack?
- **Framework:** Substrate (Polkadot SDK)
- **Language:** Rust
- **Consensus:** PoS (to be finalized)
- **Smart Contracts:** ink! (WebAssembly)

### Do I need to run a node?
Not to contribute code/docs. Testnet validators (Q2 2026) will need to run nodes.

### Where's the code?
Currently documentation phase. Code starts Q1-Q2 2026 (Substrate implementation).

### How can I test locally?
Testnet coming Q2 2026. For now, contribute to:
- Architecture decisions
- Documentation
- Tooling/scripts
- SDK design
